# Advanced Lung X-Ray Image Classification

### Introduction

This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload chest X-ray images for classification into 15 distinct lung diseases. The application uses deep learning models for classification and provides visual explanations of the model's decision-making process using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). The app is built for ease of use, with a simple interface for uploading images and generating classification reports in PDF format.

The 15 classes of lung diseases the model predicts are:

1. Normal
2. Atelectasis
3. Consolidation
4. Infiltration
5. Pneumothorax
6. Edema
7. Emphysema
8. Fibrosis
9. Effusion
10. Pneumonia
11. Pleural thickening
12. Cardiomegaly
13. Nodule
14. Mass
15. Hernia
